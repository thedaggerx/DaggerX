## üîê DaggerX V3 Security Policy

Welcome to DaggerX V3 ‚Äî a cutting-edge PHP library for secure hashing and encryption. This document outlines the security principles, developer responsibilities, and best practices to maintain the integrity of encrypted data. 

### üö® **Key Principle**  
- **The Developer Key Holds Absolute Authority.**  
- DaggerX does not store or have access to any keys.  
- Without the developer key, decryption is mathematically infeasible.  

---

## üèóÔ∏è **How DaggerX Ensures Security**
DaggerX V3 leverages modern cryptographic standards:
- **Argon2id** for memory-hard password hashing.  
- **SHA3-512** for secure peppering and key derivation.  
- **AES-256-GCM** for authenticated message encryption.  

These algorithms are designed to resist brute force and cryptographic attacks when used correctly. However, security is only as strong as the handling of the **developer key**.

---

## üîë **The Role of the Developer Key**
The **Developer Key** is the core of DaggerX V3's security model.  
- It is **exclusively used** for:
  - **Password Hashing:** Salting and peppering.
  - **Message Encryption:** Key derivation and authentication.
- **Without the correct developer key:**
  - No data can be decrypted or verified.
  - No password can be validated.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Go Wrong?**
DaggerX V3 is cryptographically secure, but human error can compromise your entire system.  

### 1. **Key Exposure**  
- **Risk:** Storing keys in plain text, source code, or insecure locations.  
- **Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Use **environment variables**, **vaults**, or **HSMs**.  
  - Avoid hardcoding keys.  
  - Rotate keys only with a secure migration plan.  

### 2. **Improper Key Rotation**  
- **Risk:** Rotating or losing keys without migrating encrypted data.  
- **Impact:** Permanent data loss.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Implement a secure **key rotation policy**.  
  - Use **versioned keys** to decrypt old data while encrypting new data with a fresh key.  

### 3. **Weak Key Generation**  
- **Risk:** Using predictable or short keys.  
- **Impact:** Easier brute-force attacks.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Use **cryptographically secure random generators**.  
  - Ensure keys are at least **256 bits** in length.  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Why It's the Developer‚Äôs Responsibility**
DaggerX V3 is built with strong cryptographic primitives, but it **cannot** protect against poor key management.  
- If your key is compromised, **it's not DaggerX's fault**.  
- If you fail to store or rotate keys securely, **it's not DaggerX's fault**.  
- DaggerX cannot decrypt or recover data without the correct key ‚Äî **only you can**.

---

## üîç **Best Practices for Key Management**
1. **Use a Secure Key Vault**  
   - Example: **HashiCorp Vault**, **AWS KMS**, or **Azure Key Vault**.  
2. **Avoid Hardcoding Keys**  
   - Use **environment variables** or **configuration files** outside the repository.  
3. **Rotate Keys with Caution**  
   - Migrate existing data before retiring old keys.  
4. **Use Strong, Unique Keys**  
   - Minimum **256 bits** with secure random generation.  
5. **Enable Automatic Backups**  
   - Store keys in multiple secure locations.

---

## üîí **No Backdoors, No Exceptions**
DaggerX V3 offers:
- **No master key**
- **No recovery mechanism**
- **No external access to your data**

If you lose your developer key, **DaggerX V3 cannot help you recover the data**. This is a deliberate security feature to ensure your sensitive data is protected at all costs.

## üöÄ **In Summary**  
- **DaggerX V3 is Secure by Design.**  
- **The Developer Key is the Ultimate Authority.**  
- **Improper Handling is the Sole Risk Factor.**

By following best practices, you can ensure DaggerX V3 remains an impenetrable shield for your sensitive data.
